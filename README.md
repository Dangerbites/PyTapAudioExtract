# PyTap
A python module that allows you to get data from hyperPad .tap files.

## Functions
`launch(tap)` - Initializes a .tap file, do this before anything else.
`get_game_details()` - Returns a JSON version of gameDetails.plist, it contains stuff such as the game name, and aspect ratios.
`get_level_details()` - Returns a JSON version of levelDetails.plist, has some dumb stuff you probably wont use.
`get_scenes()` - Returns a JSON with arrays for every scene and overlay in the project, this is one scene `{'name': 'Scene 1', 'position': (514.4542846679688, 480.0265808105469), 'zoom': 0.48193585872650146, 'preload': 0}`
`get_objects()` - Returns a JSON with every scene, inside the scenes are every object on that scene, and their data.
`get_behaviours()` - Returns a JSON of every object, and their behaviours.
`get_layers()` - Returns a JSON of every Layer in the project, each layer has its scene and if its a ui layer.
`get_project()` - Gets everything and compiles it into 1 JSON.
`extract_assets(to, format)` - Extracts all assets with the `format` to `to` (format `format` like `".png"`)
`get_asset_path(path, format, get_hd)` - Usually if you get a objects asset path, it will just be a path to the folder that has the asset in it, you can put that in here to get the actual path to the asset. (hyperPad stores a hd and non hd version of images, the non hd is half the normal size, so if you wanna get the HD make sure get_hd is `True`.)
`get_image_dimensions(path, format, get_hd)` - Gets the dimensions of an image, same inputs as `get_asset_path()`
`get_asset_size(path, format, get_hd)` - Gets the size of an asset in Bytes.
